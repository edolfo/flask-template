rpgify your life

installation
============

By default, this is made to work with [cloud9](http://c9.io/) - hence the calls
to the $IP and $PORT environment variables.

Installation requires [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).  In c9, you will need to
open a terminal, then run the following:

`easy_install pip`
`pip install flask`

Then to run the app, in the same folder as `rpgify.py`, run `python rpgify.py`.
